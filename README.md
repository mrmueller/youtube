### YouTube PowerShell Module

The purpose of this PowerShell module is to enable you to manage YouTube data from PowerShell.

### üöÄ Features

* Search for YouTube videos or channels
* Get details for YouTube videos (ie. duration, like count, comment count)
* Retrieve top-level comments from YouTube videos
* Delete a comment, from a YouTube video you own
* [Post a comment](#-üó®Ô∏è-post-comment-on-youtube-video) on a video
* Subscribe or unsubscribe from a YouTube channel

### üì¶ Installation

We recommend installing this module on [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) edition, for cross-platform compatibility.
You can install this module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com).

```
Install-Module -Name YouTube, Pode -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

This YouTube module relies on the [Pode web server]() to handle the oAuth flow.
A temporary web server will be created in order to 

### üìÑ Configuration

In order to use this module, you will need to configure an application in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

#### Standard oAuth Flow

* Create a Google Cloud Project
* Add the [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com) to your project
* Go to `APIs & Services` --> `Credentials`
* Choose `Create Credentials` --> `oAuth Client ID`
* For `Application Type`, choose `Web Application`
* Use the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values to configure the module

After doing this, run the following command:

```
Set-YouTubeConfiguration
```

After configuring the client ID and client secret values, you will need to login to your YouTube account.

```
Grant-YouTubeOAuth
```

#### Smart TV Auth Flow

* Follow the steps above to create an application
* For `Application Type`, choose `TVs and Limited Input devices` instead
* Run the `Grant-YouTube` command to initiate authentication

‚ö†Ô∏è It's important to note that this login method has reduced access to APIs, so generally you'll want to use the standard oAuth flow for server-side web applications.

### Usage

#### Search for YouTube videos.
